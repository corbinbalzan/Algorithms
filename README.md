# Algorithms
This is a git for all my favorite algorithms. They are well documented for education purposes and contain inline examples. 

It's easiest to learn these algorithms by watching a couple visualizations of YouTube first. 

These algorithms can be used to process information, study for interviews, or help with homework.
